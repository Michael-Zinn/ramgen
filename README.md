## Ramgen

Explorative Java code.

Java code that uses Ravr to generate Java code that's used by Ravr.

This is currently an unorganized hack that looks like it might turn into a macro system for Java later. It's not recommended to look at the code just yet.

This project is in symbiosis with Ravr: implementing Ramgen requires more Ravr functions which get generated by Ramgen. Bootstrapping!
